```bash
% npm install @havesource/cordova-plugin
% npx create-cordova-plugin
```

## About the CLI Input Prompts

1. **ID (npm package & directory name): (cordova-plugin-sample)**

   This is the directory and plugin name.

   The following area will be set:

   - `package.json` for the `name` and `cordova.id` fields.
   - `plugin.xml` for the `id` attribute.

2. **Readable Name: (Cordova Sample Plugin)**

   This is a human-readable name for the plugin, which is set in the `name` element of the `plugin.xml` file.

3. **Description: (A sample Cordova plugin.)**

   A brief description of your plugin, which will be added to the `description` field in the npm `package.json` and `plugin.xml` files.

4. **License (SPDX format)**

   Specify the license your plugin will use, following the SPDX format.

   It will be added to the `license` field in the npm `package.json` and `plugin.xml` files.

   If you have a custom or proprietary license, enter `"SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE"`, and be sure to create a `LICENSE` file.

5. **Author**

   This is optional.

   If provided, it will be added to the `author` field in the npm `package.json` and `plugin.xml` files.

   When empty, the `author` field will still be created but with empty values.

6. **Supported Platform: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection, and <enter> to proceed)**

   Select the platforms that your plugin will support.

   The tool will populate the `platforms` section in the `package.json`, the corresponding `platform` elements in the `plugin.xml`, and create mocked native folders and files.

7. **API Name: (SamplePlugin)**

   This will be the name used when creating the native class files of the supported platform you pick and the front-end JS API of your plugin.

8. **Android Package Name: (com.example.sampleplugin)**

   This prompt appears if you selected Android as a supported platform.
   Enter the package name that will be used for the Android plugin code. This should be distinct from your appâ€™s package name.
